I then pursued a Bachelor's degree in Media and Communication Technologies at Howest, specializing in Web & App Development. While this program prepared me as a full-stack developer, my primary passion and expertise lie in frontend development. That said, I'm always keen to expand my skillset and am open to learn new technologies.",
