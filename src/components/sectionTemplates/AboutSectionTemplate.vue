      My journey in tech began in high school, where I explored Multimedia,
      gaining proficiency in the Adobe software suite and foundational HTML &
      CSS. I then pursued a Bachelor's degree in Media and Communication
      Technologies at Howest, specializing in Web & App Development. While this
      program prepared me as a full-stack developer, my primary passion and
      expertise lie in frontend development. That said, I'm always keen to
      expand my skillset and am open to learning new technologies.<br /><br />
      Speaking of passions, it might seem contradictory given my general disdain
      for traditional printers, but 3D printing is a serious hobby of mine!
      Beyond printing, I also enjoy managing my homelab, which includes a
      Raspberry Pi running Home Assistant and Immich. Find more details about my
      homelab

      Currently, I'm applying this passion as an Open Source Consultant -
      Frontend Developer at
